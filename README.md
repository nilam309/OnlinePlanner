# OnlinePlanner

•	To Do planner Project simply implemented using MVC5 technology with the help Entity Framework 6.
•	The MVC technique aids in the development of applications that isolate the various sections of the program while maintaining a loose link between them. The pattern indicates where each type of logic in the program should be placed. This split aids in the management of complexity when developing an application by allowing you to concentrate on one area of the implementation at a time.
•	The reason behind not using ADO.NET is dealing with entities (classes/objects that describe data structure) and allowing the framework to manage the fundamental select, update, insert, and delete operations. In case of ADO.NET we have to write SQL queries directly to tables/columns/procedures in ado.net, and there are no entities, therefore it's less object oriented.
•	A simple CRUD operation with a Login functionality. Multiple users can login to the project for separate task creation.
•	LastUpdated date is update on first update by the user.
•	Delete functionality works as a soft delete.
•	When a user logs in, their information is saved in the session for future actions.
•	On User Login user details are maintained in the session for the other operations.
